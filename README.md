# user-generated-data
### Project Description
A small Python script that takes in strings of user input to gradually build up a database of different ways to say yes and no.
Inspired by the idea of creating sets of data, and made because I had nothing else to do on a particular day.

### Next steps
Perhaps scale this project to be versatile enough to bring in data from other yes.txt and no.txt files, as well as (maybe) crowdsource the data.
